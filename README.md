# SlugSense
This project was done for the CSE123AB capstone series for UCSC Engineering majors. The goal of this design is to supplement the awareness of individuals with visual disabilities. By alerting the wearer through haptic motors driven by proximity detectors, it is our hope to aid them in avoiding potentially unknown dangers.
